# Hello World in Python using Visual Studio Code

## Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to advance my technical expertise and understanding, I have created a simple "Hello World" application in Python. This project is designed to reinforce my foundational skills in programming by demonstrating a straightforward yet essential exercise. This application outputs the phrase "Hello World" to the console, serving as a baseline for more complex projects.

The purpose of this software is to provide a clear and concise example of basic Python syntax and functionality within the Visual Studio Code environment. This project is also an opportunity for me to explore and document the setup and usage of development tools for beginning Python.

Watch this brief demonstration of the application running and a walkthrough of the code:

## Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code

For this project, I utilized Visual Studio Code (VSC) as my integrated development environment (IDE). VSC offers a robust platform for Python development with features like syntax highlighting, code navigation, and built-in debugging tools.

- Python 3.9 32-bit

The project was developed using Python, chosen for its simplicity and readability which makes it an excellent choice for introductory programming tasks.

- Git / Github

I employed Git along with the hosting service Github. Git is a distributed version control system that allows for efficient tracking of changes in codebase, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members. With Git, developers like me can create branches to work on specific features or fixes independently, merge changes back into the main codebase, and resolve conflicts effectively.

Github, on the other hand, serves as a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories and enables functionalities such as code review, issue tracking, and project management.

## Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found several websites particularly useful for learning Python and setting up Visual Studio Code:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

The official Python documentation serves as the authoritative source for all things related to the Python programming language. It provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and references for Python syntax, standard libraries, and language features, making it an essential resource for developers at all skill levels.

- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

Real Python is a highly regarded online platform offering a wealth of tutorials, articles, and resources for Python developers of all skill levels. From beginner to advanced topics, Real Python covers a wide range of subjects, including Python programming techniques, best practices, web development, data science, and more. The platform's practical approach and real-world examples make it an invaluable resource for developers looking to deepen their Python knowledge and improve their coding proficiency.

- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

The official website of the Python programming language offers a wealth of resources including documentation, tutorials, and community forums to support developers at all skill levels.

- [Visual Studio Code Python Programming](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

This resource provides official documentation specifically tailored for Python development within Visual Studio Code (VSC). It offers detailed guides and tutorials on setting up Python environments, configuring Python-related extensions, and leveraging VSC's features for efficient Python coding, debugging, and testing.

- [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)

GitHub Education provides access to various tools and resources for students and educators, including free access to GitHub Pro and other developer tools to support collaborative coding projects.

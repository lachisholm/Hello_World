# Hello World in Python using Visual Studio Code

## Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to advance my technical expertise and understanding, I have created a simple "Hello World" application in Python. This project is designed to reinforce my foundational skills in programming by demonstrating a straightforward yet essential exercise. This application outputs the phrase "Hello World" to the console, serving as a baseline for more complex projects.

The purpose of this software is to provide a clear and concise example of basic Python syntax and functionality within the Visual Studio Code environment. This project is also an opportunity for me to explore and document the setup and usage of development tools for beginning Python.

## Development Environment

For this project, I utilized Visual Studio Code (VSC) as my integrated development environment (IDE). VSC offers a robust platform for Python development with features like syntax highlighting, code navigation, and built-in debugging tools.

The project was developed using Python, chosen for its simplicity and readability which makes it an excellent choice for introductory programming tasks.

## Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found several websites particularly useful for learning Python and setting up Visual Studio Code:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Visual Studio Code Python Programming](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
